      "**Game Development Requirements for Greedy Snake**\n",
      "=====================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Game Interface**\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The game interface will be a rectangular grid, divided into squares of equal size. The grid will have a fixed number of rows and columns, and the player's snake will move within this bounded space.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Grid Size**: 20x20 squares\n",
      "* **Square Size**: 30x30 pixels\n",
      "* **Background Color**: Light green (#C6F7D0)\n",
      "* **Snake Body Color**: Dark blue (#2E4053)\n",
      "* **Food Color**: Red (#FF0000)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Game Rules**\n",
      "-------------\n",
      "\n",
      "### Game Start\n",
      "\n",
      "* The game starts with a single snake unit at the center of the grid.\n",
      "* The player can move the snake up, down, left, or right using arrow keys or swipe gestures.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Gameplay\n",
      "\n",
      "* The snake moves one square at a time in the direction chosen by the player.\n",
      "* If the snake eats the food (red square), its body grows by one unit.\n",
      "* If the snake hits the boundary of the grid or its own body, the game ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scoring\n",
      "\n",
      "* Each time the snake eats the food, the player earns 10 points.\n",
      "* The score is displayed at the top-right corner of the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Game End\n",
      "\n",
      "* The game ends when the snake hits the boundary of the grid or its own body.\n",
      "* A \"Game Over\" message is displayed on the screen, along with the final score.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Multiplayer (Optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "* Up to 4 players can play simultaneously.\n",
      "* Each player controls a separate snake.\n",
      "* If two or more snakes collide, they both die and lose points.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Features**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Speed Increase**: As the snake grows longer, its movement speed increases.\n",
      "* **Food Spawn**: Food appears randomly on the grid at fixed intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds).\n",
      "* **Sound Effects**: Sound effects for eating food, hitting the boundary, and game over events.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these requirements, we can create a engaging and challenging Greedy Snake game that provides an enjoyable experience for players.\u001b[0m\n",
